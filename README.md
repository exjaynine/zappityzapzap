A nice screenwriting program utilizing PyQt6 and other python libraries. Obviously you will need pyqt6, but I will set the required python version to the same on debian has, which would be 3.11, avoid using anything higher than that requiring 3.12 or newer.  
Why python? I like python, so I picked python. I'm also comfortable using it and all the very heavy lifting will be done with non python parts like Qt6 to render the GUI toolkit and since python has a very good reading of C libraries, I can move anything that needs heavier firepower to C. Everything will turn out fine in the end when it comes to speed.
